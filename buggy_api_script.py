"""
Lab 1 — Part 2 Starter (BUGGY ON PURPOSE)
API: Cat Facts — https://catfact.ninja/
Goal: Fetch ONE cat fact and save it to data/cat_fact.txt

❗ Your job: run this script, read the error(s), consult the docs linked above,
fix the bugs, and add brief comments explaining each fix.

Hints:
- Check the endpoint path (facts vs. fact)
- Verify keys in the JSON payload
- Ensure timeouts and types are correct
- Make sure files/directories exist before writing
- Double‑check typos in file names and variables
